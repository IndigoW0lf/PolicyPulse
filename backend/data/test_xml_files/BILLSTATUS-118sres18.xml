        <text><![CDATA[ <p>This resolution permits Senators to object to the consideration of any measure unless the cost estimate and text of the measure has been available for a minimum amount of time.</p> <p>Specifically, Senators may object to consideration of a measure if the cost estimate produced by the Congressional Budget Office for the exact text of the measure has not been available for at least 24 hours. An objection raised on these grounds may be waived or suspended by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senate.</p> <p>The resolution further permits an objection to the consideration of any measure that has not been publicly available in electronic form for the mandatory minimum review period. This period is the greater of (1) the number of minutes that are equal to two times the number of pages in the measure, or (2) 72 hours, as calculated from the time the measure is made publicly available.</p> <p>The resolution also requires Senators to certify that they have read each measure prior to voting on it.</p>]]></text>
