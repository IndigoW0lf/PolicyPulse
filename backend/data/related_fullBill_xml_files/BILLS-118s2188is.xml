In 2021, approximately 71 percent of new HIV diagnoses were estimated to be among gay and bisexual men, 40 percent of new HIV diagnoses were among Black people, and 29 percent of new HIV diagnoses were among Latinx people. Recent studies suggest that transgender women are up to 49 times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV than the general population. Members of communities at the intersections of these groups are most heavily impacted.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id6d019943818547a2b090c444e6752569"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Pre-exposure prophylaxis (referred to in this section as <quote>PrEP</quote>) is a daily antiretroviral medication that helps prevent individuals from acquiring HIV.

These innovations can increase widespread use of PrEP along with adherence, which can speed the Nation’s goal to end HIV and address inequities in health care.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id6bd0ef9834944ab38bb22ad9301e3cb4"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/300gg-13">42 U.S.C. 300gg–13</external-xref>) requires non-grandfathered private health insurance plans to cover preventive services without cost-sharing, including such services with a rating of <quote>A</quote> or <quote>B</quote> under recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force.
