International agreements have recognized reproductive rights for over 25 years, and the Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted by United Nations in September 2015, reiterated the centrality of reproductive rights to gender equality. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF7ABDC5DF2444201ABB592A91984C749"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that when people, including young women and adolescent girls, gender nonconforming individuals, and transgender men, are able to control their reproductive lives, there are enormous social and economic benefits, not just for the individual and their family, but for entire communities.

The decision has emboldened anti-abortion rights actors, increased abortion stigma, and created new challenges for countries that have relied on the Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) decision in the liberalization of their own laws.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H5852DA822780446FA94535F5E289078B"><enum>3.</enum><header>Statement of policy</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">It is the policy of the United States Government—</text><paragraph id="HF16A52255B434FD483F9B0F19E93DD7C"><enum>(1)</enum><text>to recognize that safe abortion is a critical component of comprehensive maternal and reproductive health care and should be included as part of foreign assistance programs funded by the United States Government;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC05EABEDB5DB4439A8C957B51FD7C008"><enum>(2)</enum><text>to make safe abortion widely available and integrated with other types of health care; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H45B3045A2DDA4D7FB39753074FCFC413"><enum>(3)</enum><text>to work to end unsafe abortion and promote safe abortion services by providing funding and collaborating with affected governments and service providers to provide training, commodities, equipment, and access to safe abortion services.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HCCB60BFE84D84A959184D8B27FEAC3B4"><enum>4.</enum><header>Authorizing the use of Federal foreign assistance funds for comprehensive reproductive health care services</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/22/2151b">22 U.S.C. 2151b</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph id="H5D8CB22234A74825B96AD002729AA257"><enum>(1)</enum><text>in subsection (f)—</text><subparagraph id="H57F7D41F6FC4457A91181CD4EEB2C22F"><enum>(A)</enum><text>by striking paragraph (1); and</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HC9745408248447A6B1671BD9E10D3276"><enum>(B)</enum><text>by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively;</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H8AA2711BF65E47B4810F2CEDC09E07B0"><enum>(2)</enum><text>by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h); and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2C42F2F7D63D4086831A49D7D35918E9"><enum>(3)</enum><text>by inserting after subsection (f), as amended, the following:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" id="H82EA344310A548899438EA3DD679C4A1" display-inline="no-display-inline"><subsection id="H09754090AD1F42D2A81C738D5E722444"><enum>(g)</enum><header>Use of funds for comprehensive reproductive health care services</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds made available to carry out this part may be used to provide comprehensive reproductive health care services, including abortion services, training, and equipment.</text></subsection><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></paragraph></section></legis-body></bill>
