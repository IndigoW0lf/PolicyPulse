processes.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id436059b5272b4d9582e0ff67e39f8eb2"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Online platforms employ manipulative dark patterns, collect large amounts of personal information from their users, and leverage that personal information for opaque algorithmic processes in ways that create vastly different experiences for different types of users.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id3e81587debd745f0923d6caafb08748a"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Algorithmic processes are often used by online platforms without adequate testing and in the absence of critical transparency requirements and other legally enforceable safety and efficacy standards, which has resulted in discrimination in housing, lending, job advertising, and other areas of opportunity.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id0EC4C1F11B8F4E21ADAD48B145EF6516"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The use of discriminatory algorithmic processes causes disproportionate harm to populations that already experience

move their data to alternative online platforms, and the importance of this right is particularly significant given certain online platforms’ use of harmful algorithmic processes and engagement in ineffective content moderation. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="id6BC16BD0DB3C4555A98609CE3F631FEF"><enum>(9)</enum><text>In a variety of sectors, algorithmic processes also facilitate discriminatory outcomes on online platforms that individuals may not personally interact with, but which nonetheless process the personal information of such individuals and have significant, negative consequences.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id394C4529918F4F3EBE7A910B4D2C6870"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The people of the United States would benefit from the convening of experts from a diverse set
