<paragraph id="idb688fb47d54249b294c62d32786b46da"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Some school districts are violating parental and familial rights by encouraging or instructing staff to deceive or withhold information from parents if their child is seeking to <quote>transition</quote> genders. Without parental knowledge or consent, schools are facilitating <quote>social gender transitions</quote> by changing the names and pronouns of children in school, or even allowing children to change which sex-segregated facilities they use, such as dormitories for overnight field trips.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="id41ded357521343b8ac360e21e98e5126"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Powerful teachers unions and activist organizations are pressuring more schools to adopt policies to enable children, of any age, to change their gender identity at school without parental notice or consent.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="idea1645157a364e748b71846cb482a142"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Contrary to the unfounded assertions of activists, <quote>socially transitioning</quote> a child is not a neutral, uncontroversial decision, but an experimental intervention that has immediate effects on a child’s psychology and a high likelihood of changing the life path of a child. A <quote>social gender transition</quote> may make it more difficult for a child to reverse course later on, thereby increasing the likelihood that the child will continue on to a <quote>medical transition</quote>, resulting in life-changing, irreversible consequences.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="idc315e4a07ae8479ea430aec1ae7108ae"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Any policies that attempt to circumvent parental authority are a violation of parents’ constitutionally protected rights to direct the care, custody, and upbringing of their children as recognized by the Supreme Court. Further, policies that withhold information from parents or ask children about intimate details of their family life violate Federal statutes designed to uphold a parent’s rights and duties in education. School districts implementing such policies are misrepresenting or entirely ignoring these statutes and constitutional protections.</text></paragraph>
