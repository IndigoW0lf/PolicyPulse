That is equal to roughly 35 percent of United Nations member states.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id78d02de973154290a4dd88127fc1e254"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Eleven countries have jurisdictions in which the death penalty can be imposed for private, consensual same-sex sexual activity.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idaf229bbb2f67485ca139d0677e4ee92b"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Despite recent progress made toward decriminalization, marriage equality, and legal gender recognition, several countries have introduced anti-LGBTQI+ pieces of legislation that would further criminalize or stigmatize LGBTQI+ peoples. This includes a draconian law under review in Ghana that would outlaw LGBTQI+ relationships or identities, as well as actions by community allies, and bills that ban so-called LGBTQI+ <quote>propaganda</quote>, such as those in Russia and Hungary.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id91a81312392f466cbb4d68734831c8ce"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In anti-LGBTQI+ prosecutions, law enforcement officials, working in tandem with medical personnel, use the forensically discredited practice of forced anal exams to try to prove same-sex sexual activity or otherwise to torture or intimidate detainees. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has described forced anal examinations as a form of torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report in 2015 calling for governments to ban the practice. Human Rights Watch has documented several cases in which forced anal examinations have been used to sentence individuals for same-sex sexual conduct, including in Uzbekistan and Egypt.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id1c00ead94221478683c2ad1c91ff80d5"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The closing of civil society space, particularly with the increased passage or enforcement of laws that prevent the registration or operations of nongovernmental organizations, discriminates against LGBTQI+ human rights defenders and is a violation of freedom of association. This includes the wrongful closure of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a leading nongovernmental organization committed to protecting and advancing the human rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Uganda.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idb88f0d4b07374dfdb156f9df2e9dfbcd"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Extreme violence and insecurity in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras has driven LGBTQI+ people to flee their countries of origin to the United States for protection. At the United States border with Mexico, LGBTQI+ asylum seekers face additional violence and many have been returned to face persecution in their home countries or in third countries that are not safe.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id1c7e7cd047eb4d24849fda85d02295b5"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Studies have shown that structural risks, including country-level policies, prosecutions, and legal barriers, might contribute to higher HIV prevalence among LGBTQI+ people, especially gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.

The report covering 2021 continues to show a clear pattern of human rights violations or abuses in every region of the world based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics.
