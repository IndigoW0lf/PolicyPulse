Congress also recognizes that, according to the Department of Agriculture, approximately half of all adults in the United States (117,000,000 people) have 1 or more preventable chronic diseases, many of which are related to poor quality eating patterns. Accordingly, it is the policy of Congress that the Department of Agriculture should administer the supplemental nutrition assistance program in a manner that will further reduce food insecurity, increase nutrition security, and improve the diet quality for low-income people in the United States, especially children. Food programs administered by the Department of Agriculture should simultaneously combat food insufficiency and diet-related chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer, which cause immense suffering, significantly increase already high health care spending, increase poverty, and undermine military readiness.</quote>.</text></subsection><subsection id="id5989995e7e564c7f8a6bb64df460b639"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Definitions</header><text>Section 3 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/7/2012">7 U.S.C. 2012</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph id="idced12ebd87194f32b863d028bb4ef35e" commented="no"><enum>(1)</enum><text>by redesignating subsections (h) through (k), (l), (m), and (n) through (v) as subsections (i) through (l), (n), (o), and (q) through (y), respectively;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id16ff5b9a62954f28a5c2f7e0ba4ab08d"><enum>(2)</enum><text>by inserting after subsection (g) the following:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id5a1e3fd5043447edb4773da934b1c67e"><subsection id="id27674310b6184f2091a5018a9b555794"><enum>(h)</enum><header>Diet quality</header><text>The term <term>diet quality</term> means the extent to which a set of foods aligns with key recommendations of the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans published under section 301 of the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/7/5341">7 U.S.C. 5341</external-xref>).</text></subsection><after-quoted-block>;</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></paragraph><paragraph id="id375a7d2004ba407093b2b8c46de0e116"><enum>(3)</enum><text>by inserting after subsection (l) (as so redesignated) the following:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idF6744D89F21343F793031E70C4020B71"><subsection id="idc782a0b5414a4122a12db68f42f58cb3"><enum>(m)</enum><header>Food security</header><text>The term <term>food security</term> means access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.</text></subsection><after-quoted-block>;
